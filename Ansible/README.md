# What is Ansible? #
* Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates applicatiopn deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.
* Suppose an organization has 100's of systems, and given one or even a small team of people the responsibility to configure all the systems makes their work really tough and repetitive. ALso, manual work is prone to errors. Comes into picture Ansible, which can automate the configuration of all the systems.
* Ansible do so by 4 different ways:
       1. Execute taks from your own machine instead of SSH into all remote servers.
       2.  Configuration/Installation/Deployment steps in a single YAML file instead of manual and shell scripts.
       3.  Re-use same file multiple times anf dor different environments.
       4.  More reilable and less likely for errors.
